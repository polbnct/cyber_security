Viruses - Malware that can reproduce itself
-- Doesn't need you to click anything
-- It needs you to execute a program

- Reproduce through file system or the network
-- Just running a program can spread a virus

- May or may not cause problems
-- Some viruses are invisible, some are annoying

- Anti-virus very common
- Thousand of new viruses every week
- Is your signature file updated.

Type of Viruses;
- Program Viruses
-- It's part of the application

- Boot Sector Viruses
-- Who needs an OS?

- Script Viruses;
-- Operating system and browser-based

- Macro Viruses;
-- Common in Microsoft Office

Worm;
- Doesn't need you to do anything

- Keep everything up to date

Trojan Horse - used by the greeks to capture Troy from the Trojans
-- Software that pretends to be something else
-- It can conquer your computer
-- Doesn't really care much about replicating
-- Circumvents your existing security

Backdoors;
- Backdoors to the operating system that other malware can be used
- To take advantage of backdoors created by other malware

Remote Access Trojan (RATs)
-- The ultimate backdoor
-- Administrative control of a device

Malware installs the server/service/host

Control a devices;
- Keylogging
- Screen recorders
- Copy files
- Embed more malware

Mitigate the risks;
- Don't run unknown software
- Anti-virus/ anti-malware signatures updated
- Always have a backup

Rootkits;
- Originalls a Unix techniques
-- Modifies core system files / part of the kernel
- Can be invisible to the operating system
-- Invisible mostly in traditional anti-virus utilities
-- If you can't see it, you can't stop it.

Finding & Removing Rootkits;
- Look for the unusual 
- Use a remover specific to the rootkit
-- usually built after the rootkit is discovered
- Secure boot with UEFI
-- Security in the BIOS

Keyloggers;
- Your keystrokes contains valuable information
-- Web site login URLs, passwords, email messages

Save all of your input;
- Send it to the bad guys

Other data logging;

Preventing Keyloggers;
- Block unauthorized communication  (firewall rules / monitoring)
- Run a keylogger scanner (checks for keylogging activity)

- use the 3rd party bank account to send it back to the hackers

Uses of Botnets;
- Working together as a one entity to take down one community
- DDoS - uses to take down a website
- Being sold online (Renting of Botnets)

Stopping Bot;
- Prevent the initial infection by updating anti virus with the latest virus signature
- Identify existing infection through monitoring scans and on demand scans
- Prevent Command and Control by Firewall 

Logic Bomb;
- Waits for a predefined event
- Time Bomb (Time or Date)
- User Event (Logic Bomb)
- Difficult to identify

- Mostly have trojan to install a malware in the computer
- Malware Logic Bomb as it activates at a certain time

Preventing Logic Bomb;
- Process and Procedure to change (Formal Change Control)
- Electronic Monitoring (Alert on changes)
- Constant Auditing (Administrator can circumvent existing system)
