- Malicious USB Cable
-- It looks like a normal USB cable 

- Operating System Identifies it as HID
-- Human Interface Device
-- It looks like you've connected a keyboard or mouse
-- A keyboard doesn't need extra rights or permissions

- Once connected, the cable takes over (Downloads and installs malicious software)

- Don't just plug in any USB Cable, always use trusted hardware

-> Malicious Flash Drive
- Older operating systems would automatically run files
- Could still act as HID (Human Interface Device) / Keyboard)
-- Start a command prompt and type anything without your intervention

- Attackers can load malware in documents (PDF, Spreedsheets)

- Can be configured as a boot device (Infect the computer after a reboot)

- Acts as an Ether Adapter
-- Redirects or Modifies Internet Traffic Requests
-- Acts as a wireless gateway for other devices

-> Skimming

( copy data from the magnetic stripe: Card number, expiration date, card holder's name)

- ATM skimming

-- Uses the card for other financial transactions (Fraud)

-> Card Cloning
- Get card details from a skimmer 
- Create a duplicate of a card (looks and feels like the original)
