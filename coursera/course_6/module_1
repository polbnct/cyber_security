NIST CSF

Incident Response Lifecycle;
- Preparation
- Detection & Analysis
- Containment Eradication & Recovery
- Post Incident Activity

Incident - An occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or na information system.

Event - An overvable occurence on a network, system, or device.

All incident security are event but not all event are security incident

The 5W's of an incident;
- Who triggered the incident
- What happened
- When the incident took place
- Where the incident took place
- Why the incident occurred

Incident Handler's Journal;
- A form of dodcumentation used in incident response

Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) - A specialized group of security professionals that are trained in incident management and response

Roles in CSIRT;
- Security Analyst
- Technical Lead
- Incident Coordinator

Command - refers to having the appropriate leadership and direction to oversee the response.

Control - refers to the ability to manage technical aspects during incident response, like coordinating resources and assigning tasks

Communication - refers to the abilitiy to keep stakeholder informed

Elements of a Security Plan;

- Policies
- Standards
- Procedures

Incident Response Plan - A document that outlines the procedures to take in each step of incident response

Elements of an Incident plan;
- Incident Response Procedures
- System Information
- Other documents

Documentation - Any form of recorded content that is used for a specific purpose

Types of Documentation;

- Playbooks
- Incident handler's journal
- Policies
- Plans
- Final reports

Playbook - A manual that provides details about any operational actions

Wordprocessor for Documentaion;
- Google docs
- OneNote
- Evernote
- Notepad++

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - An application that monitors system and network activity and produces alerts on possible intrusions
-- Detect potential malicious activity and generate an alert once such activity is detected.
-- Don't prevent the intrusion, as it relies for individuals to investigate and act to stop the alert.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - An application that monitors system activity for intrusions and take action to stop the activity
-- Takes action to prevent / stop the malicious activity and minimize its effect

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) - is an application that monitors an endpoint for maliciouis activity.
Endpoint - is any device connected on a network (computers, phones, tablets, and more)
-- do behavioral analysis to to identify threat patterns happening in an endpoint
-- uses automation to stop attacks without manual intervention of security professional

Popular Tools that both use IDS and IPS;
- Snort
- Zeek
- Kismet
- Sagan
- Suricata

SIEM Process;
- Collect and aggregate data
-- collects data from firewalls, servers, routers and more and compile it in a data known as logs
-- aggregate the data collected in one location to eliminate the manual reviewing and analyzing event by accessing individual data sources. (by making all data accessible in one location)
Parsing maps - data according to their fields and their corresponding values.

- Normalize Data
-- Converts data into a standard, structured format that is easily searchable.

- Analyze data
-- Analysis are being done using detection logic such as a set of rules and condition.
-- if any data matches the rules it is then being sent out to cyber security professional

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) - A collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events

Log analysis - is the process of examining logs to identify event of interest.

Advantages of SIEM Tools;

Access to event data - SIEM tools provide access to the event and activity data that happens on a network, including real-time activity.
-- SIEM have an ability to ingest all of the data so that it can be accessed.

Monitoring, detecting, and alerting - SIEM tools continiously monitor systems and networks in real-time.
-- They analyze the collected data using detection rules to detect malicious activity

Log Storage - SIEM tool cna act as a system for data retention, which can provide access to historical data.

Most Common SIEM tools;
- AlienVault OSSIM
- Chronicle 
- Elastic
- Exabeam
- IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform
- LogRhythm
- Splunk
