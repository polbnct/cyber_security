Incident Detection and Verification;

Analysis - The investigatioin and validation of alerts.

Challenge with Detection;

- Impossible to detect everything
- High volume Alerts

Detection and Analysis Phase - Of the incident repsonse lifecycle, security teams are notified of a possible incident and work to investigate and verify the incident by collecting and analyzing data.

Threat Hunting - Is the proactive search for threats ona network.
-- Security professionals use threat hunting to uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as way to do further analysis on detection

Threat Intelligence - which is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats.

-- Industry reports - These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
-- Government Advisories - Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers TTP
-- Threat data feed - provide a stream of threat related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like Advance Persistent Threats (APTs)

Cyber Deception - Involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving defensive strategies

Honeypots - are an example of an active defense mechanism that use deception technology
-- are systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) - are observable evidence that suggest signs of a potential security incident

Indicators of Attack (IoA) - Are the series of observed events that indicate a real-time incident

Crowdsourcing - is the practice of gathering information using public input and collaboration

Documentation;
- Is any form of recorded content that is used for a speicfic prupose, and it is essential in the field of security

Benefits of Documentation;
- Transparencey - is critical for demostrating compliacnce with regulations and internal processes, meeting insurance requirements, and for legal proceedings
- Standardization - repeatable processes and procedures supports continuous improvement efforts, helps with knowledge transfer, and facilitates the onboarding of new team members.
- Clarity - Clear documentation helps people quickly access the information they need so they can take necessary action

Chain of Custody - The process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle

Broken Chain of Custody - Inconsistencies in the collection and logging of evidnece in the chain of custody

Chain of Custody Establish;
- Integrity
- Reliability
- Accuracy

Playbook - A manual that provides details about any operational action

Types of Playbooks;

1. Non-automated
2. Automated
3. Semi-Automated

Triage - The prioritizing of incidents according to their level of importance or urgency

Triage Process;
1. Receive and Assess - The analyst verify the validity and ensure they have complete understanding of the alert.
2. Assign Priority - Once verified the incident must be assigned a priority. Incident differs in their impact, size, and scope, which affects the response efforts.
3. Collect and Analysis - Analyst performing a comprehensive analysis of the incident.

Containment - The act of limiting and preventing additional damage caused by an incident
Eradication - The complete removal of the incident elements from all affected systems
Recovery - The process of returning affected systems back to normal operations

Business Continuity Plan (BCP) - is a document that outlines the procedures t osustain business operations during and after a significant disruption.

Post-Incident Activity Phase - The process of reviewing an incident to idnetify areas for improvement during incident handling

Final Report - Documentation that provides a comprehensive review of an incident
