Incident Detection and Verification;

Analysis - The investigatioin and validation of alerts.

Challenge with Detection;

- Impossible to detect everything
- High volume Alerts

Detection and Analysis Phase - Of the incident repsonse lifecycle, security teams are notified of a possible incident and work to investigate and verify the incident by collecting and analyzing data.

Threat Hunting - Is the proactive search for threats ona network.
-- Security professionals use threat hunting to uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as way to do further analysis on detection

Threat Intelligence - which is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats.

-- Industry reports - These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
-- Government Advisories - Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers TTP
-- Threat data feed - provide a stream of threat related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like Advance Persistent Threats (APTs)

Cyber Deception - Involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving defensive strategies

Honeypots - are an example of an active defense mechanism that use deception technology
-- are systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) - are observable evidence that suggest signs of a potential security incident

Indicators of Attack (IoA) - Are the series of observed events that indicate a real-time incident

Crowdsourcing - is the practice of gathering information using public input and collaboration
