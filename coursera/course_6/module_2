Importance of Network;

Network traffic - The amount of data that moves across a network

Network Data - The data that's transmitted between devices on a network

Indicators of Compromise (IOC) - Obervable evidence that suggest signs of a potential security incident
-- Data exfiltration - Unauthorized transmission of data from a system

Network Monitoring - maintaing situational awareness of any activity on a network

Flow - refers to the movement of network communications and includes information related to packets, protocols, and ports.

Command and Control (C2) - are the techniques used by malicious actors to maintain communicaiton with compromised systems

Packet Payload Information - Organizations can monitor the payload information of packets to uncover unusual activity, such as sensitive data transmitting outside of the network, which could indicate a possible data exfiltration

Temporal Patterns - Understanding the patterns of network traffic

Defensive Measure for Data Exfiltration;
- Prevent attacker access
- Monitor network activity
- Protect assets
- Detect and stop the exfiltration

Components of a packets;
- Header - provide information that's used to route packets to their destination

- Payload - actual data being delivered

- Footer - to provide error-checking information to determine if data has been corrupted.

Packet Sniffing - is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network

Packet capture (P-cap);
- A file containing data packets intercepted from an interface or network

Data Packet - is a basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network

Network Interface Card (NIC) - is a hardware that connects computeres to a network (receive and transmit network traffic)

Libraries and Format of P-cap;

Libpcap - is a packet capture library designed to be used by Unix-like systems, like Linux and macOS.

WinPcap - is an open-source packet capture library designed for devices running Windows operating systems

Npcap - is a library designed by the port scanning tool Nmap that is commonly used in Windows operating system

PCAPng - is a modern file format that can simultaneously capture packets and store data.

IPv4 - Most commonly used version of IP;

Header 13 fields;

- Version - This field indicates the IP version.
- Internet Header Length (IHL) - This field specifies the length of the IPv4 header including any options
- Type of Service (ToS) - This field provides information about packet priority for delivery
- Total Length - This field specifies the total length of the entire IP packet including the header and the data
- Identification - Packets that are too large to send are fragmented into Smaller pieces
-- This field specifies a unique identifier for fragments of an original IP packet so that they can be reassembled once they reach their destination
- Flags - This field provides information baout packet fragmentation including whether the original packet has been fragmented and if there are more fragments in transit
- Fragment Offset - this field is used to identify the correct sequence of fragments
- Time to Live (TTL) - this field limits how long a packet can be circulated in a network, preventing packets from being forwarded by routers
- Protocol - This field specifies the protocol used for the data portion of the pakcet.
- Header Checksum - This field specifies a checksum value which is used for error-checking the header
- Source Address - This field specifies the destination address of the receiver
- Options - This field is optional and can be used to apply security options to a packet

IPv6 - adoption has been iincreasing because of its large address spaces.

Header 8 fields;
- Version - This field indicates the IP version. 
- Traffic class - This field is similar to the IPv4 Type of Service field.
-- provides information about the packet's priority or class to help with packet delivery
- Flow label - This field identifies the packets of a flow
- Payload Length - This field specifies the length of the data portion of the packet
- Next Header - This field indicates the type of header that follows the IPv6 header such as TCP
- Hop Limit - Limits how long a packet can travel in a network before being discarded
- Source Address - This field specifies the source address of the sender
- Destination Address - This field specifies the destination address of the receiver.

Tcpdump - is a command-line network protocol analyzer.
