Importance of Network;

Network traffic - The amount of data that moves across a network

Network Data - The data that's transmitted between devices on a network

Indicators of Compromise (IOC) - Obervable evidence that suggest signs of a potential security incident
-- Data exfiltration - Unauthorized transmission of data from a system

Network Monitoring - maintaing situational awareness of any activity on a network

Flow - refers to the movement of network communications and includes information related to packets, protocols, and ports.

Command and Control (C2) - are the techniques used by malicious actors to maintain communicaiton with compromised systems

Packet Payload Information - Organizations can monitor the payload information of packets to uncover unusual activity, such as sensitive data transmitting outside of the network, which could indicate a possible data exfiltration

Temporal Patterns - Understanding the patterns of network traffic

Defensive Measure for Data Exfiltration;
- Prevent attacker access
- Monitor network activity
- Protect assets
- Detect and stop the exfiltration

Components of a packets;
- Header - provide information that's used to route packets to their destination

- Payload - actual data being delivered

- Footer - to provide error-checking information to determine if data has been corrupted.

Packet Sniffing - is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network

Packet capture (P-cap);
- A file containing data packets intercepted from an interface or network

Data Packet - is a basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network

Network Interface Card (NIC) - is a hardware that connects computeres to a network (receive and transmit network traffic)

Libraries and Format of P-cap;

Libpcap - is a packet capture library designed to be used by Unix-like systems, like Linux and macOS.

WinPcap - is an open-source packet capture library designed for devices running Windows operating systems

Npcap - is a library designed by the port scanning tool Nmap that is commonly used in Windows operating system

PCAPng - is a modern file format that can simultaneously capture packets and store data.
