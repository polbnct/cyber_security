Overview of Logs;

Log - A record of events that occur within an organization systems.

Log Details;
- Date
- Time
- Location
- Action
- Names

Log Analysis - The process of examining logs to identify events of interest

Log types;
- Network - are generated by network devices like firewalls, routers, or switches
- System - are generated by operating systems like Chrome OS, Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Application - are generated by software application and contain information relating to the events occurring within the application such as a smarthphone app.
- Security - are generated by various devices or systems such as antivirus software and intrusion detection systems.
- Authentication - are generated whenever authentication occurs such as a successful login attempt into a computer

Log Management - is the process of collection, storing, analyzing, and disposing of log data.

Logs contain;
- Timestamps
- System Characteristic
- Action

Log Format;
- Syslog - Standard logging and trnasmitting data
-- Protocol - is used to transport logs to a centralized log server for log management
-- Service - acts as a log forwarding service that consolidates logs from multiple sources into a single location
-- Log Format - is one of the most commonly used log formats that you will be focusing on.

- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) - is a file format that is used to store and transmit data.
-- Key value pair - is a set of data that represents two linnked items : a key and its corresponding value.
-- Commas - is used to separate data
-- Double Quotes - are used to enclose text data, which is also know as string.
-- Curly Brackets - which is an data type that stores data in a comma-separated list of key-value pairs.
-- Square Brackets - are used to enclose an array, which is a data type that stores data in a comma-separated ordered list.

- eXtensible Markup Language (XML) - is a language and a format used for storing and transmitting data.
-- tags - uses tags to store and identify data. - pairs that must contain a start tag and an end tag.
-- elements - include both the data contained inside of a tag and the tags itself.
-- Attributes - are used to provide additional information about elements.

- Comma Separated Values (CSV) - uses commas to separate data values.
-- Common Event Format (CEF) - is a log format that uses key- values pair to structure data and identify fields and their corresponding values.

IDS;

Telemetry - the collection and transmission of data for analysis

Signature Analysis - A detection method used to find events of interest

Host-based intrusion detection system - is an application that monitors the activity of the host on which it's installed.
-- installed in a host

Endpoint - which is any device connected to a network like a computer or a server

Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - is an application that collects and monitors network traffic and network data.

Signature Analysis - is a detection method that is used to find events of interest.
Signature - is a patterns like a sequence of binary numbers, bytes, or even specific data like an IP Address.

Anomaly-based Analysis - is a detection method that identifies abnormal behaviour.
- Training Phase - a baseline of normal or expected behavior must be established.
- Detection Phase - the current system activity is compared against this baseline.

NIDS Components;
- Action - Determines the action to take if the rule criteria is met / Alert, Pass or Object

- Header - Source and destination IP Address
-- Source and destination ports
-- Protocols
-- Traffic Directions
