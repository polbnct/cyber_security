Security Network;

Network - is a group of connected devices.

LAN (Local Area Network) - A network that spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home.

LAN -> Internet

WAN (Wide Area Network) - A network that spans a larger geographic area like a city, state, or country.

Hub - is a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the netwrok.
-- is like a radio tower that broadcast a signal to any radio tuned to the correct frequency

Switch - makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them
-- more intelligent that a hub as it only passes data to the intended destination.

Router - is a network device that connects multiple networks together.
-- connects to the internet through the use of modem.

Modem - is a device that connects your router to the internet, and brings internet access to the LAN.

Virtualization Tools - are pieces of software that perform network operations. 
-- offered by the cloud service providers.
-- allows cost savings and scalability tools.

Network Devices - maintain information and services for users of a network.
-- overall infrastracture that allows devices to communicate with each other.

Data Packets - provide information about the source and the destination of the data.

Each devices and desktop computer has a unique MAC Address and IP Address, which identify it on the network.

Firewall - is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network.
-- First line of defense in attacks.
-- can restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic.

Servers - provide information and services for devices like computers, smart home devices, and smartphones on the network.

Wireless Access Point - sends and receives digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network.
-- connect the user to wifi protocols to send through radio waves.	

Wi-Fi - refers to a set of standards that are used by network devices to communicate wirelessly.

Networkd Diagrams - are maps that show the device on the network and how they connect.
-- use small representative graphics to portray each network device and dotted lines to show how each devices connect to each other.

Client Server Model - Client send requesets to the server for informatioin and services.

Cloud Computing - is the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of an local physical devices.

Cloud Network - is a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote datacenter that can be accessed via the internet.

Cloud Service Provider - is a company that offers cloud computing services.

Software as a Service (SaaS) - refers to software suites operated byt the CSP that a company can user remotely without hosting the software.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - referest to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) - refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their comany.

Hybrid Cloud Environment - when organizations use a CSP's services in addition to their on-premise computers, networks, and storage.

SDNs (Software-Defined Networks) - are made up of virtual network devices and services.

Data Packet - A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network.

Bandwidth - The amount of data a device receives every second

Speed - The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded

Packet Sniffing - The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.

Internet Protocol - A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.

Port - A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.

Common Port Numbers; 
 
Port 25 - Email
Port 443 - Secure Internet Communication
Port 20 - Large file transfers

TCP/IP Model - A framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network.

4 Layers of TCP/IP Model;

Layer 1 (Network Access Layer) - deals with creation of data packets and their transmission across a network. 
-- This includes hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches that direct data to its destination.

Layer 2 (Internet Layer) - is where IP Addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver. 
-- Also focuses on how network connect to each other.
-- Data Packets containing information that determine whether they will stay on the LAN or will be sent to a remote network, like the internet.

Common Protocols that operate at the Internet Layer;

Internet Protocol (IP) - sends the data packets to the correct destination and relies on the Transmission Control/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) to deliver them to the corresponding service.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - shares error information and status updates of data packets. 
-- Useful for detecting and troubleshooting network errors.
-- Reports infromation about packets that were dropeed or that desappeared in transit, issues with network connectivity, and packets redirectly to other routers.


Layer 3 (Transport Layer) - includes protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network.
-- These protocols permit or deny communication with other devices and include information about the status of the connection.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before transmissions. 
-- it is used by applicaiton that are not concerned with the reliability of the transmission.
-- Data not tracked extensively.

Layer 4 (Application Layer) - Protocols determine how the data packets will interact with receiving devices. 
-- Functions that are organized at applicaiton layer include file transfers and email services.

Common Protocols used on this layer are;

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- Secure Shell (SSH)
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Domain Name System (DNS)

The OSI Model - is a standardize concept that describe the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network.
-- Network and Security Professionals often use this model to communicate with each other about potential sources of problems or security threats when they occur.

7 Layers of OSI Model;

Layer 7: Application Layer - includes processes that directly involve the everyday user.
-- This layer includes all of the networking protocols that software applications use to connect a user to the internet.

Layer 6: Presentation Layer - involve data translation and encryption for the network. 
-- This layer adds to and replaces data with formats that can be understood by application (layer 7) on both sending and receiving systems.
-- Some formats functions - encyption, compression, and confirmation that the character code set can be interpreted on the receiving system.

Layer 5: Session Layer - describes when a connection is established between two devices. 
-- An open session allows the devices to communicate with each other.
-- Session Layer protocols keep the session open while data is being transferred and terminate the session once the transmission is complete.
-- Responsible on Authentication, Reconnection, and Setting checkpoints during a data transfer.

Layer 4: Transport Layer - is responsible for delivering data between devices. 
-- handles the speed of data transfer, flow of the transfer, and breaking data down into smaller segments to make them easier to transport.
-- Segmentation is the process of dividing up a large data transmission into smaller pieces that can be processed by the receiving system.

Layer 3: Network Layer - oversees receiving the frames from the data link layer (layer 2) and delivers them to the intended destination.
-- intended destination can be found based on the address that resides in the frame of the data packets.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer - organizes sending and receiving data packets within a single network.
-- Home to switches on the local network and network interface cards on local devices

Layer 1: Physical Layer - corresponds to the physical hardware involved in a network transmission. 
-- Hubs, Modems, and the Cables and wiring that connect them are all considered part of the physical later.

TCP/IP and OSI Models - are conceptual models that help network professionals design network processes and protocols with regards to data transmission between two or more system.
