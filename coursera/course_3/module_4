Security Hardening;
- The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface

Can be conducted on:
- Hardware
- Operating Systems
- Applications
- Computer Networks
- Databases

Penetration Test;
- A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.

Attack Surface - is all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could potentially exploit in a system.

Operating System (OS) - The interface between computer hardware and the user.
-- imporatnce to secure the OS on each device because one insecure OS could lead to the whole network being compromised.

Ways to secure OS;

Patch Update - A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

Baseline Configure (Baseline Image) - A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a bsais for future builds, releases, and updates.

Strong Password Policy;
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.

Removing unused application;

Brute Force Attacks - is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information.
-- Different types of brute force attacks;

Simple brute force attacks - When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, its considered a simple brute force attack.
-- entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.

Dictionary attacks - attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system.
-- attackers originally uses a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords.

Virtual machines (VMs) - are software versions of physical computers. 
-- provide an additional layer of security for an organization because they can be used to run code in an isolated environment.

Sandbox Environments - is a type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network.
-- commonly used for testing patches, identifying and addressing bugs, or detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Prevention Measures;

Salting and Hashing - Converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity.
-- Salting adds random characters to hashed passwords. (this increase the length and complexity of hash values, making them more secure)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two-factor authentication (2FA) - is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network..

CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) - It asks users to complete a simple test that proves they are human.

Password Policies - Guidelines on a good standard of what the password should be in a professional setting.

Network Hardening;
- Port Filtering 
- Network Access Privilege
- Encryption

Network Log Analysis - the process of examining network logs to identify events of interest.

Security Information and Event Management tool (SIEM) - An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.

Port Filtering - A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication.

Fiewalls - allow or block traffic based on a set of rules.
-- Firewalls inspect data packets and only allows the ones that have the needed port number.

Intrustion Detection System (IDS) - is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible instrusions.
-- it detect known attacks
-- discovers anomally
-- only detects malicious traffic and not defend it

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - Monitors the system and takes action to stop malicious activities

Clouds;

Identity Access Management (IAM) - is a tool that are used to manage digital identities in the cloud.

Configuration - is one of the high requirement to the security to not allow any malicious actors to breach the cloud system.

Attack Surface - is entry points on which malware or malicious actors can break into. As the cloud expand more entry points becomes vulnerable making the cloud in need of increase in security measure.

Zero Day Attack - an exploit in a softare or system that are not known by the public or developer.

Cyptography - is one kind of encryption that scrambles the information that is unreadable to anyone that does not have the encryption keys.


Cryptographic Erasure - is a way of destroying the decryption keys making the encypted file undecryptable.
