Intrusion Attack the Compromise the System;

Packet Sniffing - when malicious actors use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit.
-- attack that cause damage to an organization's network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering the message and an organization's network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering the message and interrupting network operations.

Backdoor Attacks;
- is another type of attack you will need to be aware of as a security analyst.
-- installed by attackers after they've compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.
-- performing DoS attack - is an attack that targets a network or a server and floods it with network traffic.

Impact to an Organization;

Financial - when a system is taken offline with a DoS attack or some other tactic, they prevent a company from performing tasks the generate revenue.

Reputation - Attacks can also have a negative impact on the reputation of an organization. If it becomes public knowledge that a company has experienced a cyber attack, the public may become concerned about the security practice of the organization.

Public Safety - If an attack occurs on a government network, this can potentially impact the safety and welfare of the citizens of a country.

DoS Attack Goal - is to disrupt normal business oprations by overloading an organization's network.
-- The goal of the attack is to send so much information to a network device that it crashes or is unable to respond to legitimate users.

Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) - is a kind of DoS attack that uses multiple devices or servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

-- It doesn't matter which part of a network overloads, if they overload anything they win.

3 common Network Level DoS attacks;
SYN flood Attack - is a type of DoS attack that simulates the TCP connection and floods the server with SYN packets.

First step of a Handshake - The device send a SYN or synchronize, request to the server. And the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the device's request and leaves a port open for the final step of the handshake.
-- Once the server receives the final ACK packet from the device, a TCP connection is estalished.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.

ICMP Flood Attack - is a type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP packets to a network server.
-- this forces the server to send an ICMP packet. That will eventually lead to the crash of the server.
-- Takes advantage of communication protocols by sending an overwhelming number of request.

Ping of Death Attack - is a type of DoS attack that is caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64 kilobytes. (the maximum size of correctly formed ICMP packet)

Network Protocol Analyzer - sometimes called a packet sniffer or a packet analyzer.
-- is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.

Common type of Analyzer include:
- SolarWinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer
- ManageEngine OpManager
- Azure Network Watcher
- Wireshark
- tcpdump

tcpdump - is a command-line netowrk protocol analyzer. It is popular, lightweight-meaning it uses little memory and has a low CPU usage-and uses the open-source libpcap library.
-- is a text based, meaning all commands in tcpdump are executed in the terminal.
-- provodes a brief packet analysis and converts key information about network traffic into formats easily read by hiumans.

20:00:29.538395 - Timestamp - The output begins with the timestamp, formatted as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second.

198.168.10.1 - Source IP - Packets origin is provided by its source IP address.

41 - Source Port - This port number is where the packet originated.

198.111.123.1 - Destination IP - is where the packet is being transmitted to.

61012 - Destination port - This port number is where the packet is being transmitted to

Packet incldues header - contains receiver's IP address and MAC address.

Packets Body - contain valuable information like names, date of birth, personal message, financial information, and credit cards.

Packet Sniffing - is the practice of using software tools to ovserve data as it moves across a network.
-- Malicious act of gathering hands on information of others to take advantage of people vulnerabilities.

Passive Packet Sniffing - is a type of attack where data packets are read in transit. 

Active Packet Sniffing - is a type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit.

IP Spoofing - A network attack performed when an attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network.

Common IP Spoofing Attack;

On-path Attack - An attack where a malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts or alters the data in transit.

Replay Attack - A network attackperformed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at another time.

Smurf Attack - A network attack performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized user's IP address and floods it with packets.
