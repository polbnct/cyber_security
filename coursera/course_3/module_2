Network Protocols - A set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of the data

When connecting to a website the user uses TCP;

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - An internet communications protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.
-- Isn't limited to just two devices.
-- It established a direct connection between two endpoints, but the underlying network infrastructure can handle routing data packets across multiple devices.
-- Verifies both devices before any communication to take place. (Handshake)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. 
-- Less reliable that TCP, but works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly.
-- One use of UDP is for sending DNS request to local DNS servers.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - A network protocol used to determine the MAC address of the next router or device on the path
-- ensures that data goes to the right place

HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) - A network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers.

Domain Name System;
- A network protocol that translates internet domain names into IP address.

Upon visiting 1 website the browser uses 4 Protocols;
TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS

HTTPS secures data using Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security or also known as SSL/TLS

Management Protocols;
- Are usede for monitoring and managing activity on a network.

Simple Network Mangement Protocol (SNMP) - is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network.
-- can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.
-- used by a receiving device to send a report to the sending device about the data transmission.
-- commonly used as a quick way to troubleshoot network connectivity and latency by issuing the "ping" command on linux operating system.

Network Address Translations;
Outgoing Message where the router replace a private source IP Address with its public IP Address and perform the reverse operation for response.

- generally requires a router or firewall to be specifically configure to perform NAT.
- part of later 2 (internet layer) and layer 3 (transport layer) of the TCP/IP Model

Local Home or Office Network - Have both private IP Address & Public IP Address

Public IP Address - Represents all devices that is in LAN.

Private IP Address;
- Assigned by the router
- Unique only within private network
- No cost to use
- Address ranges:
-- 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
-- 172.16.0.0-172.31.225.255
-- 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255

Public IP Address;
- Assigned by ISP and IANA
- Uniques address in global internet
- Cost to lease a public IP Address
- Address ranges:
-- 1.0.0.0-9.255.255.255
-- 11.0.0.0-126.255.255.255
-- 128.0.0.0-172.15.255.255
-- 172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255
-- 192.169.0.0-233.255.255.255

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - is in the management family of network protocols.
-- is an application layer protocol used on a network to configure devices.
-- it works with the router to assign a unique IP Address to each device and provide the addresses of the appropriate DNS Server and default gateway for each device.

Address Resolution Protocol;
- is mainly a network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model used to translate the IP Addresses that are found in data packets into the MAC Address of the hardware devices.

-- Keeps track of matching IP and MAC Addresses in an ARP Cache. 
-- does not have a specific port number since it is layer 2 protocol and port numbers are associated with the layer 7 application layer.

Telnet;
- is an application layer protocol that is used to connect with a remote system.
- sends all information in clear text.
- uses command line prompts to control another device similar to secure shell (SSH), but Telnet can be used to connect to local or remote devices and uses TCP port 23.

Secure Shell;
- is used to create a secure connection wit ha remote system.
-- application later protocol provides an alternative for secure authentication and encrypted communication.
-- SSH Operates over the TCP port 22 and is a replacement for less secure protocols, such as Telnet.

Post Office Protocol (POP);
- is an application layer (layer 4 of the TCP/IP model) protocol used to manage and retrieve email from a mail server.
- POP3 is the most commonly used version of POP.
- TCP/UDP port 110 and encrypted emails use Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) over TCP/UDP port 995.

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP);
- is used for incoming mail, it downloads headers of emails and the message content.
- uses TCP port 143 for unencrypted email and TCP port 993 over the TLS protocol.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP);
- is used to transmit nad route email from the sender to the recipient's address.
- works with Message Transfer Agent (MTA) software, which searches DNS Servers to resolve email addresses to IP Addresses, to ensure emails reach their intended destination.
- uses port 25 for unencrypted emails and TCP/UDP port 587 using TLS for encrypted emails.
- TCP port 25 is often used by high-volume spam. When in turn, SMTP helps regulates spam.

Protocol and Port Numbers;
- are used by network devices to determine what should be done with the information contained in each data packet once they reach their destination.
- firewalls are used to filter out unwanted traffic based on port numbers.

Protocols;
DHCP - UDP port 67 (servers) & UDP port 68 (clients)
ARP - None
Telnet - TCP port 23
SSH - TCP port 22
POP3 - TCP/UDP port 110(unencrypted) & TCP/UDP port 995 (encrypted, SSL/TLS)
IMAP - TCP port 143 (unencrypteded) & TCP port 993 (encrypted, SSL/TLS)
SMTP - TCP/UDP port 25 (unencrypted)
SMTPS - TCP/UDP port 587 (encrypted, TLS)


IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
- A set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs

WiFi Protected Access (WPA);
- A wireless security protocol for devices to connect to the internet network.

WiFi - refers to a set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs.
-- is a marketing term commissioned by the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) 

-- belongs to 802.11 family of internet communication standards determined bu the IEEE.

-- it is secured by wireless networking protocols.

-- WPA2 & WPA3

Wired Equivalent Privacy;
- is a wireless security protocol designed to provide users with the same level of privacy on wireless network connections as they have on wired network connections.
- developed in 1999 and is the oldest of the wireless security standards.

WPA;
- developed in 2003 to improve upon WEP, address the security issues presented, and replace it.
- was always intended to be transitional measure so backwards compatibility could be established with older hardware.
- WPA encryption algorithm uses larger secret keys than WEPs, making it more difficult to guess the key by trial and error.
- includes a message integrity check that includes a message authentication tag with each transmission.

WPA2;
- was released in 2004.
- improves upon WPA by using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- uses TKIP
- uses the Counter Mode Cipher Block Chain Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)
- security standard for all Wi-Fi transmissions today.

Personal;
- is best suited for home networks for a variety of reasons.
- the global passphrase for WPA2 personal version needs to be applied to each individual computer and access point in a network.

Enterprise;
- is best for business applications
- provides necesssary security for wireless networks in business settings.
- offers individualized and centralized control over the Wi-Fi access to a business network.

WPA3;
- is a secure Wi-Fi protocol and is growing in usage as more WPA3 compatible devices are released.
- WPA3 Addresses that authentication handshake vulnerability to KRACK attacks, which is present in WPA2.
- uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), a password-authenticated, cipher-key-sharing-agreement.
-- this the prevents attackers from downloading data from wireless network connections to their systems to attempt to decode it.
- has increased encryption to make passwords more secure by using 128-bit encryption, with WPA3-Enterprise mode offering optional 192-bit encryption.

Firewalls;

Firewall - is a network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network. It either allows traffic or it blocks it based on a defined set of security rules.

Two Kinds of Firewall;

Hardware Firewall - is considered the most basic way to defend against threats to a network.
-- inspects each data packet before it's allowed to enter the network.

Software Firewall - performs the same functions as a hardware firewall, but it's not a physical device.
-- software program installed on a computer or on a server.
-- it analyze all the traffic received by the computer.
-- it will protect all the devices connected to the server.

Other kinds of Firewalls;

Cloud Based Firewalls or FaaS;
- are software firewalls hosted by a cloud service provider.
- will perform security operations on all incoming traffic before it reaches the organization's onsite network.
-- also protect assets in the cloud.

2 Kinds of States of Firewalls;

Stateful - refers to a class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats.
-- Analyzes network traffic for characteristics and behaviours that appear suspicious and stops them from entering the network.

Stateless - referes to a class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and does not keep track of information from data packets.
-- Only acts according to preconfigured rules set by the firewall administrator.
-- Doesn't store analyzed information.
-- It doesn't discover suspicious trends like a stateful firewall does.

NGFWs (Next Generation Firewalls) - provides even more security that a stateful firewall.
-- provide inspection of incoming nad outgoing traffic.
-- performs more in-depth security functions like deep packet inspection and intrusion protection.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) - is a network security device that changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you're using a public network like the internet.
-- Also encrypt your data as it travels across the internet to preserve confidentiality.

Encapsulation - A process performed by a VPN service that protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets.

Security Zones;

Security Zones - are a segment of a network that protects the internal network from the internet
-- Part of the security technique that is called network segmentation that divides the network into segments.
-- Controls who can access different segmenets of a network.
-- Act as a barrier to internal networks, maintain privacy within corporate groups, and prevent issues from spreading to the whole network.

Oragnizations network is classified into two types of security zones;

Uncontrolled Zone - which is any netwokr outside of the organization's control, lilke the internet.

Controlled Zone - which is a subnet that protects the internal network from the uncontrolled zone.
Types of networks within controlled zone;
- Outer Layer is Demilitarized zone, or DMZ, which contains public-facing services that can access the internet
- DNS servers that provide IP addresses for internet users.

DMZ - acts as a network perimeter to the internal network.

Internal Network - contains private servers and data that the organization needs to protect.

Restricted Zone (inside of internal network) - protects highly confidential information that is only accessible to employees with certain privileges.

Subnetting - is the subdivision of a network into logical groups called subnets.
-- it works like a network inside a network.
-- divides up a network address range into smaller subnets within then network.
-- Allows network professionals and analysts to create a network within their network without requesting another network IP addresses from their internet service provider.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) - is a method of assigning subnet masks to IP addresses to create a subnet.
-- reduce the number of entries in routing tables and provides more available IP addresses within networks.

Classfull Addressing - was used in the 1980s as a system of grouping UP addressses into classes (Class A to Class E)

Proxy Servers;

Proxy Server - are another system that helps secure networks.
-- a server that fulfills the request of a client by forwarding them on to other servers.

Foward Proxy Server - A server that regulates and restricts a person's access to the internet.

Reverse Proxy Server - A server that regulates and restricts the internet's access to an internal server.

3 Main Categories of Network Protocols;

Communication Protocols - are used to establish connection between servers.
Ex. TCP, UDP, and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

Management Protocols - are used to troubleshoot network issues.
Ex. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

Security Protocols - provide encryption for data in transit.
Ex. IPSec and SSL/TLS

Other Commonly used Protocols;

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) - is an application layer communication protocol. This allows the browser and the web server to communicate with one another.

DNS (Domain Name System) - is an application layer protocol that translates, or maps host names to IP Addresses.

APR (Address Resolution Protocol) - is a network layer communication protocol that maps IP Addresses to physical machine or a MAC address recognized on the local area network.
