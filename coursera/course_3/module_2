Network Protocols - A set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of the data

When connecting to a website the user uses TCP;

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - An internet communications protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.
-- Isn't limited to just two devices.
-- It established a direct connection between two endpoints, but the underlying network infrastructure can handle routing data packets across multiple devices.
-- Verifies both devices before any communication to take place. (Handshake)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. 
-- Less reliable that TCP, but works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly.
-- One use of UDP is for sending DNS request to local DNS servers.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - A network protocol used to determine the MAC address of the next router or device on the path
-- ensures that data goes to the right place

HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) - A network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers.

Domain Name System;
- A network protocol that translates internet domain names into IP address.

Upon visiting 1 website the browser uses 4 Protocols;
TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS

HTTPS secures data using Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security or also known as SSL/TLS

Management Protocols;
- Are usede for monitoring and managing activity on a network.

Simple Network Mangement Protocol (SNMP) - is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network.
-- can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.
-- used by a receiving device to send a report to the sending device about the data transmission.
-- commonly used as a quick way to troubleshoot network connectivity and latency by issuing the "ping" command on linux operating system.
