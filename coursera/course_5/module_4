Phishing - The usue of digital communcation to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

Phishing kit - A collection of software tools needed to launch a phishing campaign

Vishing - The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a know source

Angler Phishing - is a technique where attackers impersonate customer service representative on social media.


Malware;
- Software designed to harm devices or networks

5 Common types of Malware;

1. Virus - Malicious code written to intefere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
2. Worm - Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own
-- no need to execute

3. Trojan - Malware that looks like a legitimate file or program 

4. Ransomware - Type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access

5. Spyware - Malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent

Cross-site scripting - An injection attack that inserts code into a vulnerable website or web application

3 Types of cross-site scripting attacks;

2. Stored

Input Sanitization - Programming that removes user input which could be interpreted as code

3 Main types of SQL Injections;

- In-band SQL injection - is the most common type of SQL Injection.
-- The one that uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather the results.

- Out-of-Band injection - is one that uses a difference communication channel to launch the attack and gather the result.

- Inferential SQL injection - occurs when an attacker is unable to directly see the results of their attack.
-- They can interpret the results by analyzing the bahavior of the system.
