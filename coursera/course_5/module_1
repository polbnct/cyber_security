Teams helps on mitigating the risk in a company.

Risk - Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset (CIA Triad)

Security Plan is based on 3 parts;

- Assets 
- Threats 
- Vulnerabilities

-- measuring on the affect of each parts of the security

Asset - an itema perceived as having value to an organization
-- Building, Idea, People, Data, etc.

Threat - Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

Vulnerability - A weakness that can be exploted by a threat

Asset Management - The process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them
-- Asset Inventory - A catalog of assets that need to be protected
-- Asset classification - The practice of labelling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization

Level of Asset Classification;

- Public - can be shown to anyone
- Internal-Only - can be show to those that are inside the asset
- Confidential - can only be shared to people that handles the speicifc project
- Restricted - Highly sensitive assets that must be protected

-- used if an asset can be disclose or destroyed

Most valuable thing in an asset - Data!

Data - Information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer.

3 Different state on Protecting the Data;

Data in use - Data being accessed by one or more users

Data in transit - Data travelling from one point to another

Data at rest - Data not currently being accessed

Information Security (InfoSec)
- The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

Cloud;

Softare as a service (SaaS)
- refers to front-end applications that users access via web browser.
- The service providers host, manage, and maintain all of the back-end systems for those applications.

Platform as a service (PaaS)
- refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online.
- Developers use these resources to write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- customers are given remote access to a range of back-end systems that are hosted by the cloud service provider.
- Google Cloud Platoform
- Microsoft Azure

Cloud Security - is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, application, and infrastructure in the cloud.

Security Plans;

Types of Risk Categories;
- Damage
- Disclosure
- Loss of Information

Elements of Security Plans;
- Policies
- Standards
- Procedures

Policy - A set of rules that reduces risk and protects information

Standards - References that inform how to set policies

Procedures - Step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task

NIST Cybersecurity Framework; (CSF)
- A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

3 Main Components of CSF;
- Core
- Tiers
- Profiles

Core five functions;
- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

Tiers - is a component that measure performance across each of the five function of the core.
-- designed in a way of showing organizations what is and isn't working with their security plans

Profiles - provides the current state of the security plan

Compliance - The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations

Regulations - Rules set by a government or other authority to control t he way something is done.
