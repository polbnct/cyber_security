NIST Cyber Security Framework;

Security Frameworks - Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Ex. Social Engineering, Ransomware, etc.

Security Controls;
- Used to reduce specific risks.
- Safeguards designed to reduce specific risks.

3 Types of Controls;

Encryption
- is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format
- Converting to cypertext / needed to be decrypted to be readable

Authentication
- Process of verifying who someone or something is
- MultiFactor Authentication, 2-step verification

-Biometrics
-- Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity
-- Fingerprint, Eyescan, etc.

-Exploitation;
--Vishing - The explotation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source
- Impersonate person voice to commit a crime.

Authorization;
- The Concept of granting access to speicifc resources within a system.

CTF (Cyber Threat Framework) - is a government way to provide a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.
- The CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.

-------

CIA Triad - A model that helps inform how organizations cosider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

C - Confidentiality
I - Integrity
A - Availability

Confidentiality - Only authorized users can access specific assets or data

Integrity - The data is correct, authentic, and reliable

Availability - Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

NIST S.P 800-53
- A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal governement.

5 Core Function;

Identify - The management of cybersecurity risk and its affect on an organization's people and assets

Protect - The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

Detect - Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.
 
Response - Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.
 
Recover - The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.

Proactive -> Reactive 
- Must have an ability to recover to incidents

OWASP Security Principles;

OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project

Principles;

- Minimize attack surface area;
-- Attack surface - refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

- Priciple of least privilege;
-- Main reason is to reduce the damage of a security breach.

- Defense in depth
-- means that an organization should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways.

- Separtion of duties;
-- used to prevent individuals from carrying out fraudulent or illegal activities.

- Keep Security Simple;
-- when implementing security controls, unnecessarily complicated solutions should be avoided because they can become unmanageable.

- Fix Security Issues Correctly;
-- Its important to correct any identifies vulnerabilities and conduct tests to ensure that repairs are successful.

Security Principles - are embedded in your daily tasks. Whether you are analyzing logs, monitoring a security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard, or using vulnerability scanner, you will use these principles in some way.

Additional OWASP Security Principles;

- Establish Secure Defaults - This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure.

- Fail Securely - means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option.

Don't trust service;
- Many organizations work with third party partners. These outside partners often have different security policies that the organization does.
- An otganization shouldn't explicitly trust that their partners' systems are secure.

Avoid Security by Obscurity;
- The security of key systemsm should not rely on keeping details hidden.

Security Audtis - A review of an orgnaization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations

Internal Audits;

Purpose;
- Identify Organizational Risk
- Assess Controls
- Correct Compliance Issues

Common Elements;
- Establishing the scope and goals
- Conducting a risk assessment
- Completing a controls assessment
- Assessing compliance
- Communicating results

Scope - refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit

Examples of Scope;
- Assess user permission
- Identify Existing Controls, Policies, and Procedures
- Account for technology currently in use

Goals - are an outline of the organization's security objectives

Examples of Goals;
- Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations
- Fortify systems control

Risk Assessment - focused on identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps organizations consider what security measures should be implemented and monitored to ensure the safety of assets.

Example of Risk Assessment;
- There is a lack of propert management of physical and digital assets; equipment used to store data is not properly secured; and access to private information in the organization's internal network needs more robust controls in place.

Audit Questions;
- What is the audit meant to achieve?
- Which assets are most at risk?
- Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
- What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

Controls Assessment - Closely reviewing an organization's existing assets, then evaluating potential risks to those assets, to ensure internal controls and processes are effective.

Control Categories;
- Administrative Controls
-- relates to the human component of cybersecurity. They include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data, such as the implementation of password policies.

- Technical Controls
-- are hardware and software solutions used to protect assets, such as the use of intrusion detection system, or IDS's, and encryption.

- Physical Controls
-- refers to measures put in place to prevent physical access to protected assets, such as surveillance cameras and locks.

Communication;
- Summarizes scope and goals
- Lists existing risks
- Notes how quickly those risks need to be addressed
- Identifies compliance regulations
- Provides recommendations
