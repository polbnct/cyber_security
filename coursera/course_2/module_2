NIST Cyber Security Framework;

Security Frameworks - Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Ex. Social Engineering, Ransomware, etc.

Security Controls;
- Used to reduce specific risks.
- Safeguards designed to reduce specific risks.

3 Types of Controls;

Encryption
- is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format
- Converting to cypertext / needed to be decrypted to be readable

Authentication
- Process of verifying who someone or something is
- MultiFactor Authentication, 2-step verification

-Biometrics
-- Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity
-- Fingerprint, Eyescan, etc.

-Exploitation;
--Vishing - The explotation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source
- Impersonate person voice to commit a crime.

Authorization;
- The Concept of granting access to speicifc resources within a system.

CTF (Cyber Threat Framework) - is a government way to provide a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.
- The CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.

-------

CIA Triad - A model that helps inform how organizations cosider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

C - Confidentiality
I - Integrity
A - Availability

Confidentiality - Only authorized users can access specific assets or data

Integrity - The data is correct, authentic, and reliable

Availability - Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

NIST S.P 800-53
- A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal governement.
