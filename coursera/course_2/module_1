8 Security Domains (CIISP)

1 - Security and Risk Management;
- All organizations must develop their security posture.
- Security Posture is an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data to react to change.

-- Security Goals and Objectives.
-- RIsk Mitigation Process.
-- Compliance
-- Business Continuity Plans
-- Legal Regulations
-- Professional and Organizations Ethics

List of InfoSec Design Processes;

- Incident Response
- Vulnerability Management
- Application Security
- Cloud Security
- Infrastructure Security.

2 - Asset Security;
- Involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data.
- Conducting a Security analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset.

3 - Security Architecture and Engineering;
- Used on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization's assets and data.

Design Principles;

- Threat Modeling
- Least Privilege
- Defense in Depth
- Fail Securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it Simple
- Zero Trust
- Trust but Verify

Managing data - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools.

4 - Identify and Access Management;

- IAM (in short) - focuses on keeping data secure.
- Ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized.

5 - Communication and Network Security;

- Focuses on Managing and Securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communication.

6 - Security Assessment and Testing;
- Focuses on Identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 
- Help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risks.
- Uses pet testers to find vulnerabilities that could be xploited by a threat actor.

7 - Security Operations;
- Focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occured.

Strategies, Processes and tools such as;

- Training awareness
- Reporting and Documentation
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- SIEM tools
- Log Management
- Incident Management
- Playbooks
- Post-breach Forensics
- Reflection on Lessons Learned

8 - Software Development Security;

- focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications.
- Secure applications deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.
