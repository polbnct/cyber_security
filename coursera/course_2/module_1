8 Security Domains (CIISP)

1 - Security and Risk Management;
- All organizations must develop their security posture.
- Security Posture is an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data to react to change.

-- Security Goals and Objectives.
-- RIsk Mitigation Process.
-- Compliance
-- Business Continuity Plans
-- Legal Regulations
-- Professional and Organizations Ethics

List of InfoSec Design Processes;

- Incident Response
- Vulnerability Management
- Application Security
- Cloud Security
- Infrastructure Security.

2 - Asset Security;
- Involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data.
- Conducting a Security analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset.

3 - Security Architecture and Engineering;
- Used on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization's assets and data.

Design Principles;

- Threat Modeling
- Least Privilege
- Defense in Depth
- Fail Securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it Simple
- Zero Trust
- Trust but Verify

Managing data - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools.

4 - Identify and Access Management;

- IAM (in short) - focuses on keeping data secure.
- Ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized.

5 - Communication and Network Security;

- Focuses on Managing and Securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communication.

6 - Security Assessment and Testing;
- Focuses on Identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 
- Help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risks.
- Uses pet testers to find vulnerabilities that could be xploited by a threat actor.

7 - Security Operations;
- Focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occured.

Strategies, Processes and tools such as;

- Training awareness
- Reporting and Documentation
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- SIEM tools
- Log Management
- Incident Management
- Playbooks
- Post-breach Forensics
- Reflection on Lessons Learned

8 - Software Development Security;

- focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications.
- Secure applications deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.

Risk Management;
- An primary goal of organizations is to protect assets.

Assets;
- Is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
- Can be digital or physical
Examples;

- Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or unique identification numbers assigned to individuals.
- Dates of Birth
- Bank account numbers
- Mailing addresses

Physical Assets Examples;
- Paymennt Kiosks
- Servers
- Desktop Computers
- Office spaces

Common Strategies used to manage risks;
- Acceptance - Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
- Avoidance - Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- Transference - Transferring risk to a thrid party to manage
- Mitigatioin - Lessening the impact of a known risk

Threats;
- is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

Insider Threats;
- Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

Risks;
- is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.

Different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk ot an organization's assets;

- External Risk - Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information.

- Internal Risk - A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk

- Legacy System - Old Systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems.

- Multiparty risks - Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.

- Software compliance/licensing - Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner.

- Read OWASP for standard documentation

Vulnerabilities;
- is a weakness that can be exploted by a threat.

Some Vulnerabilities include;
- ProxyLogon - A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange Server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location

- ZeroLogon - A vulnerability in Microsoft's Netlogon authenticaiton protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person;s identity. 
- Netlogon is a service that ensures a user's identity before allowing access to a website's location.

- Log4Shell - Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else's computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.

- PetitPotam - Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-Based Attacker to initiate an authentication request.

- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures - Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it.

- Server-side Request Forgery - Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat acots to steal data.
