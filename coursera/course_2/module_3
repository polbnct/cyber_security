Logs and SIEM Tools;

Log - is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks.

3 Common Logs;

Firewall Logs - is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet.

Network Log - is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and service on the network.

Server Log - is a record of events related to services such as websites, email, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username request.

SIEM Tool (Security Information and Event Management) - an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.

SIEM Dashboards - Helps security analysts quickly and easily access their organization's security information as charts, graph, or tables.

SOAR (Security orchestration, automation, and response) - is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events.

Metrics - are key technical attributes including response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application.

Industry Leading SIEM Tools;

Self Hosted - It require organization to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity.

Cloud Hosted - are maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet.

Hybrid - Both Self Hosted and Cloud Hosted mix together.

Splunk - is a data analysis plateform and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solution.

Splunk Enterprise - is a self hosted tol used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data to provide security infromatioin and alerts in real time.

Google Chronicle - is a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and serach data.
-- Provide log monitoring, data analysis, and data collection.
-- fully maintained and managed by the vendor.

Tools;

Open Source - are often free to use and can be user friendly.
-- The objective of open-source tools is to provide users with software that is built by the public in a collaborative way, which can result in the software being more secure.

Common Misconception of Open Source tools - is that it is less effective and not as safe to use as proprietary tools. However, developers have been creating open-source materials for years that have become industry standards.

Example of Open-Source tools;

Linux - is an open-source operating system that is widely used.
-- It allows you to tailor the operating systems that you needs using a command-line interface.
-- Operating system - is the interface between computer hardware and the user.

Suricata - is an open-source network analysis and threat detection software.
-- Network analysis and threat detection software is used to inspect network traffic to identify suspicious behavior and generate network data logs.
-- developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation).
-- Dedicated to maintaining open-source use of the suricata projejct to ensure its free and publicly available.

Splunk Dashboards and their purpose;

Security Posture Dashboard - is designed for security operations centers (SOCs)
-- it displays the last 24 hours of an organization's notable security-related events and trends and allows security professionals to determine if security infrastructure and policies are performing as designed.

Executive Summary Dashboard - analyzes and monitors the overall health of the organizations over time. 
-- This helps security teams improve security measure that reduce risk.

Incident Review Dashboard - Allows analysts to identify suspicious patterns that can occur in the event of an incident. 
-- It assists by highlighting higher risk items that need immediate review by an analyst.

Risk Analysis Dashboard - helps analysts identify risk for each risk object (e.g a specific user, a commputer, or an IP address). It shows changes in risk-related activity or behaviour, such as user loggin in outside of normal working hours or unusually high network traffic from a specific computer.

Chronicle analyze log data according to;
- A specific Asset
- A domain name
- A user
- An IP address

Enterprise Insights Dashboard - highlights recent alerts.
-- It identifies suspicious domain names in logs, known as indicators of compromis (IOCs)

Data ingestion and health dashboard - shows the number of event logs, log sources, and success rates of data being processed into Chronicle.

IOC Matches Dashboard - indicates the top threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to the organization.

Main Dashboard - displays a high-level summary of information related to the organization's data ingestion, alerting, and event activity over time. 

Rule Detections Dashboards - provides statistics related to incidents with the highest occurences, severities, and detections over time.

User sign in overview Dashboard - provides information about user access behavior across the organization.
