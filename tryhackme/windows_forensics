Introduction to Windows Forensics;

Forensics Artifacts:
- are essential pieces of information that provide evidence of human activity

Microsoft Windows - Most commonly used Desktop Operating System of All.

The reason why OS is collecting information is to personalized the computer of the user.

But, the Forensics Investigator takes advantage of this fact and use this information to tally up cases of crimes.

Windows Registry - is a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data.
-- This configuration data can be about the hardware, the software, or the user's information.

Registry Hive - is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk.

Windows Five Root Keys;

1. HKEY_CURRENT_USER
2. HKEY_USER
3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
4. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
5. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on.
-- The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here.
-- Abbreviated as HKCU

HKEY_USERS - Contains  all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer.
-- Abbreviated as HKU

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - Contains configuraiton information particular to the computer (for any user)
-- Abbreviated as HKLM

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT - Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer.
-- Abbreviated as HKCR

HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG - Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.

Accessing refistry hives offline;

1. Default (Mounted on HKEY_USER\DEFAULT)
2. SAM (Mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM)
3. Security (Mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY)
4. Software (Mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software)
5. System (Mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System)

Hives containing user information;

User profile directory - C:\Users\<username>\

1. NTUSER.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER when user logs in)
2. USRCLASS.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES)

USRCLASS.DAT hive is located in the directory - C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows

NTUSER.DAT hive is located in directory - C:\Users\<username>\

REMEMBER - NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT are hidden files.

The Amacache Hive;
- is a very important hive called the AmCache hive. Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.
- C:Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve


Transactional Logs & Backups;

Transaction log is each sotred as a .LOG file.

Transaction log for the SAM hive will be located in C:\Windows\System32\Config

Registry Hives Located in C:Windows\System32\Config and are copied to C:\Windows\System32\Config\Regback directory every ten days.
-- Excellent place to look if you suspect that some registry keys might have been deleted/modified recently

KAPE - is a live data acquisition and analysis tool which can be used to acquire registry data.

Autopsy - gives you the option to acquire data from both live systems or from a disk image.

FTK Imager - is a similar to Autopsy and allows you to extract files from a disk image or a live system by mounting the said disk image or drive in FTK Imager.

Amcache.hve - is a file that is often necessary to investigae evidence of programs that were last executed.

Tools on Viewing Windows Registry;

Registry Explorer - It can load multiple hives simultaneously and add data from transcation logs into the hive to make a more 'cleaner' hive with more up-to-date data.
-- also handy on bookmarks option containing forensically important registry keys often sought by forensics investigators

RegRipper - is a utility that takes a registry hive as input and outputs a report that extracts data from some of the forensically important keys and values in that hive.
-- Both available in CLI and GUI

SAM:
- contains user account information, login information, and group information.

Mainly Located - SAM\Domains\Account\Users

Control Sets - The hives containing the machine's configuration data used for controlling system startup.

Different Keys with File Extension - .pdf, .jpg, .docx

Registry Explorer - allows us to sort data contained in registry keys quickly.

Shellbag Explorer - shows us the information in an easy-to-use format.

UserAssist - Windows keeps track of applications launched by the user using Windows Explorer for statistical purposes in the User Assist registry keys.

-- The keys contain information about the programs launched, the time of their launch, and the number of times they were executed.

ShimCache - is a mechanism used to keep track of applicaiton compatibility with the OS and tracks all applications launched on the machine.
-- Main purpose in Windows is to ensure backward compatibility of applications. (Application Compatibility Cache)

Stores;
- File Names, File Sizes, and last modified time of the executables

AmCache (hive) - is an artifact related to ShimCache. 
-- this performs a similar function to ShimCache, and sotres additional data related to program executions.
-- the data includes execution path, installation, execution and deletion times, and SHA1 hashes of the executed programs.

BAM/DAM;
- A tab on the activity of background applications.
-- is a part of Microsoft Windows that optimizes the power consumption of the device.
