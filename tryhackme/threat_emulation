What is threat Emulation?

- Threat Emulation is meant to assist security teams and organisations, in general, in better understanding their security posture and their defence mechanisms and performing due diligence in their compliance.

Cyber Security Assessment Issues;

-- Are our people traned and alert?
-- Are our internal processes effective?
-- has the technology in use properly configure and delivered value to the business?

Vulnerability Assessments - Are conducted to identify vulnerabilities in assets under a defined sccope.

Focus -- Comprehensive and based on the rulse of the engagement defined, as assessments do not include exploitation.

Penentration Testing - involves exploiting vulnerabilities within an organisation under strict control of the scopr and rules of engagement.

Pentest - provide oraganisations with information about their security posture, patching vulnerabilities and where to invest in security training or practices.

Red teaming - provides a means of looking at cyber security issues from an adversary's perspective. 

Threat Emulation - is an intelligence-driven impersonatinon of real-world attack scenarios and TTPs in controlled environment to test, assess and improve an organisation;s security defences and response capabilities.

Real-world threats - The MITRE ATT&CK framework and cyber threat intelligence are common information sources to ensure threat TTPs are based on actual breaches, APTs and campaigns

Behaviour-focused - The execution of TTPs during an emulation exercise aims to tune defences based on behaviours and not signatures, thus adapting to the elements of the Pyramid.

Transparency - Disclosure of activities between the Red and Blue teams during execution ensures that the security posture is improved holistically.

Collaborative - due to common goal of improving organisational security, threat emulations allows team to collaborate in their efforts.

Repeatable - Some emulation tasks would bedone multiple times in the course on an exercise or numerious exercises.

Assessment & Improvement - The goal is to test personnel, assess security processes and evaluate the technology adopted.

Capability Development - Emulation enable the creation, modificaaiton and application of tools and analytics derived from TTPs

Professional Development - This breaks down the barriers between red and blue teams and fosters collaboration missions.

Emulation Methodologies;

Mitre ATT&ck framework;
- is an industry-known knowledge base that provides information about knonw adversarial TTPs observed in actual attacks and breaches.

The Atomic Red Team - is a library of emulation tests developed and curated by Red Canary that can be executed to test security defences within an organisation.

Choose an ATT&CK technique -> Choose a test for that techniques -> Execute the test procedure -> Analyse your detections of the procedures -> Make improvements to your defense.

TIBER-EU Framework
- The Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming is the European Framework developed to deliver controlled, bespoke, intelligence-led emulation testing on entities and organisations' critical live systems.
(like purple teaming)

Three phase of TIBER-EU Framework;

1. Preparation Phase;
- During these phase, the security teams involved in the test are established, and the entity's management determines and approves the socpe.  this represents the formal launch of adversarial testing by endusring all the planning and procurement processes are fulfilled.

2. Testing Phase;
- During this phase, the security teams involved in the test are established, and the entity's management determines and approves the scope. This represents the formal launch of adversarial testing by ensuring all the planning and procurement processes are fullfilled.

3. Closure Phase; 
- Once the tests are run and defense measured, the emulation team must consider reporting and remediation measures. Each group will draft their analysis reports, including details of the test conducted, finding and recommendations for technical controls, policies, procedures, and awareness training.

CITD (Center for Threat Informed Defense)
- Non-profit research and development organisation operated by MITRE Engenuity. Its misison is to promote the practice of threat informed defence.
- Curated open source adversary emulation library.

2 Approaches on their emulation;

Full Emulation;
- This is a comprehensive approach to emulating a particular adversary.

Micro Emulation;
- This approac is more focused, emulating behaviours accross multiple adversaryes, such as file access or process injection techniques.
