Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) - can be defined as evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them.

Data - Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.

Information - A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as "How many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the month?"


Intelligence - The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.

Primary goal of CTI - Understand the relationshipi between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against any attacks.

- Whos attacking you?
- What are their motivations?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?

Different type of Categories:

- Internal;
-- Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
-- Cyber awareness training reports
-- Systems logs and events.

- Community;
-- Open web forums
-- Dark web communities for cybercriminals

External;
-- Threat intel feed (Commercial & Open-Source)
-- Online Marketplaces
-- Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.

Threat Intelligence Classifications;

Strategic Intel - High level intel that looks into the organisations threat landscape and maps out the risks areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.

Technical Intel - Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary

Tactical Intel - Assess adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) 

Operational Intel - Looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack.

Direction;
Threat Intel Program Requriees the following parameters;
- Information assets and business processes that require defending.
- Potential impact to be experienced on losing the assets or through process interruptions.
- Source of data and intel to be used towards protection
- Tools and resources that are required to defend the assets.

Collection;
- Once objectives have been defined, security analysts will gather the required data to address them. 
-- Analyst will use commercial, private and open-source resources available.

Processing;
- Raw logs, vulnerability information, malware and network traffic usually come in different formats and may be disconnected when used to investigate an incident.

Analysis;
- Once the information aggregation is complete, security analysts must derive insights decisions to be made may involve;
-- Investigating a potential threat through uncovering indicators and attack patterns.
-- Defining an action plan to avert an attack and defend the infrastracture.
-- Strengthening security controls or justifying investment for additional resources.

Dissemination;
- Different organisational stakeholders will consume the intelligence in varying languages and formats. For example, C-suite members will require a concise report covering trends in adversary activities, financial implications and strategic recommendations.

Feedback;
- The final phase covers the most crucial part, as analysts rely on the responses provided by stakeholders to improve the threat intelligence process and implemntations fo security controls.
