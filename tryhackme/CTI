Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) - can be defined as evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them.

Data - Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.

Information - A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as "How many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the month?"


Intelligence - The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.

Primary goal of CTI - Understand the relationshipi between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against any attacks.

- Whos attacking you?
- What are their motivations?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?

Different type of Categories:

- Internal;
-- Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
-- Cyber awareness training reports
-- Systems logs and events.

- Community;
-- Open web forums
-- Dark web communities for cybercriminals

External;
-- Threat intel feed (Commercial & Open-Source)
-- Online Marketplaces
-- Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.

Threat Intelligence Classifications;

Strategic Intel - High level intel that looks into the organisations threat landscape and maps out the risks areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.

Technical Intel - Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary

Tactical Intel - Assess adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) 

Operational Intel - Looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack.

Direction;
Threat Intel Program Requriees the following parameters;
- Information assets and business processes that require defending.
- Potential impact to be experienced on losing the assets or through process interruptions.
- Source of data and intel to be used towards protection
- Tools and resources that are required to defend the assets.

Collection;
- Once objectives have been defined, security analysts will gather the required data to address them. 
-- Analyst will use commercial, private and open-source resources available.

Processing;
- Raw logs, vulnerability information, malware and network traffic usually come in different formats and may be disconnected when used to investigate an incident.

Analysis;
- Once the information aggregation is complete, security analysts must derive insights decisions to be made may involve;
-- Investigating a potential threat through uncovering indicators and attack patterns.
-- Defining an action plan to avert an attack and defend the infrastracture.
-- Strengthening security controls or justifying investment for additional resources.

Dissemination;
- Different organisational stakeholders will consume the intelligence in varying languages and formats. For example, C-suite members will require a concise report covering trends in adversary activities, financial implications and strategic recommendations.

Feedback;
- The final phase covers the most crucial part, as analysts rely on the responses provided by stakeholders to improve the threat intelligence process and implemntations fo security controls.

CTI Standards and Frameworks;

ATT&CK Frameworks - is a knowledge base of adversary behaviour, focusing on the indicators and tactics. Security analysts can use the information to be thorough while investigating and tracking adversarial behaviour.

TAXII (The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) - defines protocols securely exchanging threat intel to have near real-time detection, prevention and mitigation of threats.

- Two Models;
-- Collection - Threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer upon request by user using a request-response model.
-- Channel - Threat intel is pushed to users from a central server through a publish subscribe model.

STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) - is a language developed for the "Specification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat information" 

Cyber Kill Chain - Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain breaks down adversary actions into steps. This breakdown help analysts and defenders identify which stage-specific activities occurred when investigating an attack.

Diamond Model - looks at intrusion analysis and tracking attack groups over time. It focuses on four key areas each representing a different point on the diamond.

These are; 
- Adversary - The focus here is on the threat actor behind an attack and allows analysts to identify the motive behind the attack.

- Victim - The opposite end of adversary looks at an individual, group or organisation affected by an attack.

- Infrastracture - The Adversaries'tools, systems, and software to conduct their attack are the main focus. 

- Capabilities - The focus here is on the adversary;s approach to reaching its goal . This looks at the means of exploitation and the TTPs implemented accross the attack timeline.

Notable Threat Reports;

- Mandiant
- Recorded Future
- AT&TCybersecurity
