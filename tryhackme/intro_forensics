Forensics - is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts. 
-- With the use and spread of digital systems, such as computers and smartphones, a new branch of forensics was born to investigate related crimes: Computer forensics, which later evolved into, digital forensics.

Two types of investigation;

1. Public-sector investigations - refer to the investigations carried out by government and law enforcement agancies. They would be part of a crime or civil investigation.

2. Private-sector investigations - refers to the investigatioins carried out by corporate bodies by assigning a private investigator, whether in-house or outsourced. They are triggered by corporate policy violatioins.

Basic plan of investigation;

1. Acquire the evidence - Collect the digital devices such as laptops, storage devices, and digital cameras.

2. Establish a chain of custody - Fill out the related form appropriately. The purpose is to ensure that only the authorized investigators have access to the evidence and no one could have tampered with it.

3. Place the evidence in a secure container - You want to ensure that the evidence does not get damaged. In the case of smartphones, you want to ensure that they cannot access the netwrok, so they don't get wiped remotely.

4. Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab.

At the Lab;

1. Retrieve the digital evidence from the secure container.
2. Create a forensic copy of the evidence: The forensic copy requires advanced software to avoid modifying the original data.
3. Return the digital evidence to the secure container: You will be working on the copy. If you damage the copy, you can always create a new one.
4. Start processing the copy on your forensics workstation.

Digital Forensics includes;
- Proper Search Authority - Investigators cannot commence without proper legal authority.
- Chain of Custody - This is necessary to keep track of who was holding the evidence at any time.
- Validation with mathematics - Using a special kind of mathematical function, called a hash function, we can confirm that a file has not been modified.
- Use of validated tools - The tools used in digital forensics should be validated to ensure that they work correctly.
- Repeatability - The findings of digital forensics can be reproduced as long as the proper skills and tools are available.
- Reporting - The digital forensics investigation is concluded with a report that shows the evidence related to the case that was discovered.
