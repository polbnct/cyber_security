-> Fields

Fields are separated between;
- Selected Fields - fields that contains the upmost important data to you
- Interesting Fields - have values in at least 20% of the events 

Default Fields;
- Host, Source, and Sourcetypes are selected by default

a - denotes a hash value
# - denotes a numeral

Easily returns source - sourcetype=values

Field Operators;
= and != - Used with numerical or string values
> >= < <= - Used with numerical values

Difference between != and NOT boolean;
- The != returns event that are not [value]
- The NOT returns all the events that do not have a field or status equals to [value]

Automatically Ingested Data on the Fields;
- host
- sourcetype
- source

Internal field;
- _time
- _raw

-> Temporary Fields - can also be created on an ad-hoc basis using commands such as "eval"

- | eval -> is used to calculate and manipulate field values

Field Extraction -> can be used to extract data from your data that are not automatically extracted for its assigned sourcetype

- | erex & | rex -> extracts fields from your data using regular expression or regex

-- erex - is like automatic field extraction in the field extractor
-- rex - allows you to use regular expression named capture groups to extract values at search time -> it can be used on field values or raw data - allows you to match multiple groups

-> Calculated fields - can only reference fields that are already present in the events returned by a search

-> Field alliases - allows you to assign alternative names to fields in your data
-- does not replace or remove the original field name

Operations Order;
Field Extraction -> Field Aliases -> Calculated Fields -> Lookups -> Event types -> Tags
