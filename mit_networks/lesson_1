Lecture 1: Introduction to Social and Economic Networks.

Introduction:

What is networks?
- In the case of social and economic networks, these units (Nodes) - are usuallyindividuals or firms.

- The connections between them (Links) can repressent any of a wide range of relationships: friendship, business relationship, communication channel, etc.

Herd Immunity - is the fraction of the population that must be immune to the virus (through either past infection or vaccination) to cause infections to fall.

Social and Economic networks are characterized by these both things;
- Pattern of linkage 
- Interactions and decisions that take place over the links.

Graph Theory - Physical modeling of network structure
Game Theory - Strategic modeling of Interactive behaviour

Networks with N nodes - N(N-1) / 2

How to understand netowrks?
- Develop theoretical frameworks for identifying key properties of networks and the processes that play out on them
- Frameworks will be application-dependent, with important commonalities.
- There are commonalities, but also important differences, in the factors that determine the spread of an epidemic disease vs the spread of a new technology.

Dynamic Networks - networks that vary over time; their vertices are often not binary and instead represent a probability for having a link between two nodes.

Graphs - Networks mathematically that formalize patterns of relationships (Links) between different unit (nodes).
- can be directed or undireccted, depending on what kind of relationship they represent.

- can also be weighted or unweighted, depending on whether links differ their importance, capacity, likelihood of materializing, etc.

Simplest form (unweighted graph) is G = (N,E)

N = set of n nodes in the graph (e.g. websites, individuals)
E = set of edges, linking nodes in the graph.

Sociology - is largely about group interactions:  thus, network structure is naturally important.

- Notions such as social capital, power, or leadership may be best understood by studying the network of interactions within groups.

Strength of Weak ties - People finding jobs with acquitances and not with close friends

Examples of Networks;

How do people learn about new products?
- Japanese graphic novel example
- "Cult Following"

How does a new technology spread?
- Hybrid corn example
- Word-of-mouth from early adopters leads to a distinctive adoption pattern.

How do people form their political, social and religious opinions?
- Imitate family, friends, and neighbors?
- More sophisticated information aggregation by talking and observing friends and news soruces.
- Howdo social networks matter?

Wisdom of the crowds - Combining the information of many, particularly people with different perspectives and diverse experiences, lead to better decisions.
