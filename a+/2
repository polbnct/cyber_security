- IP -------------------------------

-> Network topology
-- Ethernet, DSL, cable system

-> Internet Protocol (IP)
- Boxes of TCP and UDP

Visualization;
Client (Ethernet Header) -> Ethernet Payload -> (Ethernet Trailer) Server

[ IP , TCP, HTTP data ]

-> TCP and UDP
- Transported inside of IP
-- Encapsulated by the IP protocol
-- Two ways to move data from place to place
-- OSI Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
-- Multiplexing
--- Use many different applications at the same time

-> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Connection-oriented
-- A formal connection setup and close
- Reliable delivery
-- Recovery from errors
-- Can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions
- Flow Control
-- The receiver can manage how much data is sent

Computer -> TCP Data -> <- TCP ACK <- Server

-> User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Connectionless 
-- No formal open or close to the connection
- Unreliable delivery
-- No error recovery
-- No reordering of data or retransmission
- No flow control
-- Sender determines the amount of data transmitted

Computer -> UDP DAta -> Server

Why would you use UDP?
- Real-time communication
-- There's no way to stop and resend the data
-- Time doesn't stop for your network

-> Connectionless protocols
-- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuraiton Protocol)
-- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

- Data might not get through
-- The application keeps track and decides what to do
-- It might not do anything

Communicaiton using TCP ---

- Connection-oriented protocols prefer a "return receipt"
-- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
-- SSH (Secure Shell)

- The application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data
-- TCP handles all of the communication overhead
-- The application has one job

-> Speedy deliver
- The IP delivery truck delivers from one (IP) address to another (IP) Address
-- Every house have unique ID
- Boxes arrive at the house / IP address
-- Where does box go?
- Port is written on the outside of the box
-- Drop the box into the right room

-> Lots of Ports
- IPv4 sockets;
-- Server IP Address, protocol, server application port number
-- Client IP Address, protocol, client port number

- Non-ephemeral ports - permanent port numbers
-- Ports 0 through 1,023
-- Usually on a server or service

- Ephemeral ports - temporary port numbers
-- Ports 1,024 through 65,535
-- Determined in a real-time by client

-> Port numbers
- TCP and UDP ports can be any number 0 and 65,535
- Most servers (services) used non-ephemeral (non-temporary) port numbers
-- This isn't always the case (It's just a number)
- Port numbers are for communication, not security
- Service port numbers need to be "well-known"
- TCP port numbers aren;t the same as UDP port numbers

-> Ports on the network
- Web server - tcp/80
- VoIP server - udp/5004
- Email server - tcp/143

---------------------------------------------------------

-> Port Numbers

- udp/53
- There are very critical resources
-- Usually multiple DNS servers are in production

-> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Autoated configuration of IP Address, subnet mask and other options
- udp/67, udp/68
- Requires a DHCP server
-- Server, Applicance, integrated into a SOHO router, etc.

- Dynamic / pooled
-- Ip addresses are assigned in real-time form a pool
-- Each system is given a lease and must renew at set interval

- DHCP reservation
-- Addresses are assigned by MAC address in the DHCP server
-- Manage addresses from one location

-> HTTP and HTTPS
Protocols;
- HTTP - tcp/80 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Web server communication
- HTTPS - tcp/443 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure - Web server communication with encryption

-> POP3 / IMAP
- Receive emails from an email server
-- Authenticate and transfer

- POP3 = Post office Protocol version 3
-- tcp/110
-- Basic mail transfer functionality

- IMAP4 = Internet Message Access Protocol v4
-- tcp/143
-- Includes management of email inbox from multiple clients

- Server Message Block (SMB)
- Protocol used by Microsoft Windows
-- File sharing, printer sharing
-- Also called CIFS (Common Internet File System)

--------------------------------------

-> IP Addressing
- IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything we do
-- Included in almost all configurations
-- Internet Protocol version 4
-- OSI layer 3 address
- Networking;
-- IP Address, e.g., 192.189.1.165 (needs to have a unique IP address)
-- Subnet mask, e.g., 255.255.255.0 (used by local device to determine whaqt subnet it's on
-- Default gateway, e.g., 192.168.1.1 (must be an IP address on the local subnet)

- IPv6 is now part of all major operating systems
-- And the backbone of our internet infrastructure
-- Internet Protocol v6 - 128-bit address
-- First 64 bits is generally the network prefix (/64)
-- Last 64 buts us then the host network address

DNS Servers;
- Translates names and IP Addresses
- You configure two DNS servers in your IP Configuration

---------------------------------------------------------------

-> DHCP
- IPv4 address configuration used to be manual
-- IP Address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, DNS Server, NTP servers, etc.

- October 1993 - The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
-- Some manual configuration still required
-- BOOTP also didn't know when an IP Address might be available again

- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
-- Intially released in 1997, updates through the years
-- Provides automatic address / IP Configuration for almost all devices

-> DHCP Process (DORA)

- Discover
-- Find a DHCP Server
- Offer 
-- Get an Offer
- Request
-- Lock in the offer
- Acknowledge 
-- DHCP server confirmation

Turning Dynamic into static
--> DHCP assigns an IP address from the first available from a large pool of addresses
-- Your IP Address will occassionally change
--> You may not want your IP Address to change
-- Server, Printer, or personal preference
--> Disable DHCP on the device
-- Configure the IP address infromation manually
-- Requires additional administration
--> Better: Configure an IP reservation on the DHCP Server
-- Associate a specific MAC address with an IP address

-> Avoiding Manual Configuration
- No DHCP server reservation
-- You configure the IP Address manually
- Difficult to change later
-- You must visit the device again
- A DHCP reservation is preferable
-- Change the IP Address from the DHCP Server

-> Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
- A link-local address
-- No forwarding by routers
- IETF has reserved 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255
-- First and last 256 addresses are reserved
-- Functional block of 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255

- Automatically assigned 
-- Uses ARP to confirm the address isn't currently in use

------------------------------------

-> Domain Name System
- Translates huma-readable names into computer-readable IP addresses
-- You only need to remember the name of the site

- Hierarchical
-- Follow the path

- Distributed database
-- Many DNS Servers
-- 13 root server clusters (Over 1,000 actual servers)
-- Hundreds of generic top-level domain (gTLDs) - .com, .org, .net, etc.
-- Over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) - .us, .ca, .uk, etc.

DNS Hierarchy
- . 
- .com, .net, .edu, .org, - Top-Level Domains (TLDs)
- Domain Name
- www, live, mail, east, west,
- trey, katie, ethan, judy, etc.

-> DNS Record
- Resource Records (RR)
-- The database records of domain name services

- Over 30 record types
-- IP Addresses, certificates, host alias names, etc.

- These are important and critical configuration
-- Make sure to check your settings, backup, and test!

-> Address record (A) (AAAA)
- Defines the IP Address of a host
-- This is the most popular query

- A records are for IPv4 addresses
-- Modify the A record to change the host name to IP address resolution

- AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses
-- The same DNS server, different records

-> Mail exchange record (MX)
- Determines the host name for the mail server
-- This isn't an IP address; its a name

-> Text records (TXT)
- Human-readalbe text information
-- Useful public information
-- Was originally designed for informal information

- Can be used for verification purposes
-- If you have access to the DNS, then you must be the administrator of the domain name

- Commonly used for email security
-- External email servers validate information from your DNS

-> Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- SPF protocol
-- A list of servers authorized to send emails for this domain
-- Prevent mail spoofing
-- Mail servers perform a check to see if incoming mail really did come from an authorized host

-> Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
- Digitally sign a domain's outgoing mail
-- Validate by mail servers, not usually seen by the end user
-- The public key is in the DKIM TXT record

-> DMARC
- Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
-- Prevent unauthorized email use (spoofing)
-- An extension of SPF and DKIM

- You decide what external email servers should do with emails that don't validate through PSF or DKIM
-- That policy is written into DMARC TXT record
-- Accept all, send to spam, or reject the email
-- Compliance reports can be sent to the email administrator
