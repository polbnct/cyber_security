Lesson 1:

-> Laptop Hardware;
- Engineered to precise spcification (Challenging Repair)
- Some laptops are easier to fix than others
(Ongoing learning process)
- Understand the process (may vary between other laptops)

-> Laptop Batteries;
-- The power source when unplugged
-- Five minutes vs one hour

- Using Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo) are common
-- No "memory effect"
-- Changing the battery diminished capacity

- Different form factor for each laptop
-- Battery types and styles can vary
-- Battery technology is changing constantly

-> Laptop Keyboard;
- The most-used component of the laptop
-- Can be easy to replace
-- A few screws and a single ribbon cable

- Or connect external USB keyboard
-- Not very portable, but works in a pinch

-> Laptop Keys
-- Some repairs might require the removal or replacement of a key cap
-- Check with the manufacturer's instructions (It's very easy to accidentally break the key can or the components underneath)

-> Laptop Memory
- Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)
- Memory used in laptops nad mobile devices (Often easy to install and replace)
- Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board

-> Laptop storage
- Magnetic Disk
-- Traditional spinning drive platters
-- 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)

- SSD (Solid-state drive)
-- All memory, no moving parts
-- Silent, fast access time, less latency
-- 2.5 inch form factors

- M.2 
-- Smaller form factor
-- No SATA data or power cables
-- Easy to install and replace

- Replacing Laptop Storage
-- All internal (Open a cover on the back, Open the entire laptop)
-- Can be very modular (Two screws and the drive slides out
-- M.2 drives are even easier (One screw and Similar to RAM installation)

-> Migrating from HDD to SSD
- An impressive upgrade
-- Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory
-- It's almost like getting a new laptop

- Install an OS on the SSD
-- Move user documents between drives
-- Install any required applications
-- Can be time consuming

- Image/clone the HDD
