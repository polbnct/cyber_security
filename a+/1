-> Laptop Hardware;
- Engineered to precise spcification (Challenging Repair)
- Some laptops are easier to fix than others
(Ongoing learning process)
- Understand the process (may vary between other laptops)

-> Laptop Batteries;
-- The power source when unplugged
-- Five minutes vs one hour

- Using Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo) are common
-- No "memory effect"
-- Changing the battery diminished capacity

- Different form factor for each laptop
-- Battery types and styles can vary
-- Battery technology is changing constantly

-> Laptop Keyboard;
- The most-used component of the laptop
-- Can be easy to replace
-- A few screws and a single ribbon cable

- Or connect external USB keyboard
-- Not very portable, but works in a pinch

-> Laptop Keys
-- Some repairs might require the removal or replacement of a key cap
-- Check with the manufacturer's instructions (It's very easy to accidentally break the key can or the components underneath)

-> Laptop Memory
- Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)
- Memory used in laptops nad mobile devices (Often easy to install and replace)
- Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board

-> Laptop storage
- Magnetic Disk
-- Traditional spinning drive platters
-- 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)

- SSD (Solid-state drive)
-- All memory, no moving parts
-- Silent, fast access time, less latency
-- 2.5 inch form factors

- M.2 
-- Smaller form factor
-- No SATA data or power cables
-- Easy to install and replace

- Replacing Laptop Storage
-- All internal (Open a cover on the back, Open the entire laptop)
-- Can be very modular (Two screws and the drive slides out
-- M.2 drives are even easier (One screw and Similar to RAM installation)

-> Migrating from HDD to SSD
- An impressive upgrade
-- Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory
-- It's almost like getting a new laptop

- Install an OS on the SSD
-- Move user documents between drives
-- Install any required applications
-- Can be time consuming

- Image/clone the HDD
-- No OS installation required
-- Move everything from one to the other
-- Imaging software needed (Many commercial and open source options)
-- Create an image file (one drive at a time)
-- Drive-to-drive image (Image directly from one drive to the other)

-> 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth

- Wireless Network Connectivity (Connect without wires)
-- Connect without wires

- 802.11
-- Local are network (LAN)
-- High speed
-- Internet Access

- Bluetooth
-- Personal are Network (PAN)
-- Short range
-- Connect peripherals and other nearby devices

-> Biometrics
- Sign in or unlock your laptop with a fingerprint reader or face recognition
- Requires additional configuration in the OS (Hardware requred for most options)
- Relatively Secure (Faces and Fingerprints are quite unique)

-> Near Field Communication (NFC)
- Short Distance Networking
-- 4 centimeter or less
-- Data transfers or authentication

- Common on mobile phones and smart watches
-- Payment method on your wrist

- Use it for authentication without typing a password
-- Hospital workstations
-- Warehouses
-- Manufacturing

----------- Laptop Displays ----------------------

-> Portable LCD

- Liquid Crystal Display
-- Light shines through liquid crystals

- Advantages
-- Lightweight
-- Relatively Low Power
-- Relatively inexpensive

- Disadvantages
-- Black levels are challenge
-- Requires separate backlight
--- Florescent, LED, etc.
--- Lights are difficult to replace

-- 3 Technologies of LCD -- :

-> TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
- The original LCD technology
- Fast response times (gaming)
- Poor viewing angles - color shifts

-> IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
- excellent color representation
- Moreexpensive to produce than TN

-> VA (Vertical Aligment) LCD
- A good compromise between TN and IPS
- Good color representation
- Slower response times than TN

-> OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
- Organic compound emits light when receiving an electrical current

- Thinner and lighter
-- Flexible and Mobile - no glass needed 

- No Backlight
-- The organic compound provides the light

- Tablets, Phones, Smart Watches
-- Very accurate color representation
-- A bit higher cost than LCD

-> Wi-Fi Antennas
- Multiple antennas
-- WiFi main and aux 
-- Bluetooth

- Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen

-> Webcam
- Video Capture
-- Built-in camera and microphone

- Usually includes both audio and video
-- Specialized drives and softwares

-> Microphone
- Built-in to the laptop display
-- Useful for video calls

- Not good for non-casual use
-- Analog or USB microphones can help

-- Fluorescent vs LED backlighting --

-> CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp
-- Higher voltage and power needed
-- Added thickness to the display
-- No longer a common backlight
-- Older laptops will use these

-> LED - backlit LCD Display
-- Backlight is LEDs instead of florescent
-- LEDs around the edge of the screen
-- An array of LEDs behind the screen 
-- The latest laptops are LED-backlit

-> Backlight and inverter
- LCD Displays need a backlight
-- Florescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your eyes

- Some laptops have inverters
-- Turn DC into AC

- Verify backlight
-- Look closely
-- Use a flashlight

- May need to replace the LCD inverter or display

-> Digitizer
- Use a pen-like device as input
-- Stylus input
-- Useful for graphical input

- Used commonly on laptops / tablets
-- Or hybrid devices

- Touchscreen
-- Merge laptop and tablet input
--- Digitizer reponds to touch
--- No keyboard required but often still available

- Many options for input
-- Use the best one for the job

- Connecting Mobile Devices -----------------

- Phones and Tablets
-- Many different ways to connect

- Wired and Wireless connectivity
-- Standard and options change through the years

- Used for synchronization, connectivity, backup, and identification
-- Sometimes simultaneously

-> Universal Serial Bus (USB)
- high-speed wired communication
- Used for charging and data transfers

- Micro-USB
-- A smaller USB connection
-- Common now worldwide

- Older devices may use Mini-USB
-- Slightly Larger

- USB-C
-- 24-pin double-sided USB connector
-- Acts as a USB 2.0/3.0/3.1/4 Connection

- Can transmit other signals
-- DisplayPort
-- HDMI
-- Thunderbolt

- Lightning
-- Apple proprietary (8pins)
-- Iphone and Ipad

- Higher power output for phones and tablets
- Can be inserted either way
- Simpler design

-> Serial Interfaces

- DB-9 (DE-9)
-- Commonly used for RS-232 signals
--- Recommended Standard 232
--- An industry standard since 1969

-- Serial Communications standard
--- Traditionally used for modems connections

-- Used as a configuration port
--- Switches, Routers, Firewalls, etc. (Use a USB to DB-9 converter table)

-> Near Field Communication (NFC)
- Sends small amounts of data wirelessly over a limited area
- Built into your phone
- Can be used as Access token, identity "card"

-> Bluetooth
- High speed communication over short distances (PAN)
- Can be connected to our mobile devices

-> Hotspot
- Your own personal wireless router
- Extend the cellular data network to all of your devices
- Dependent on phone type and provider (May require additional charges and data cost)
